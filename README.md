=============

Trinket Timer project

This is a project that I designed to turn on a device at a preset time, and then turn it off an another preset time.  I also included a lighted button to show when it was on, and allow override to turn off or on.

Originally build using an Arduino Uno, but then switched to Adafruit Trinket.
