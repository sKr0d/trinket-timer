The Trinket Timer was initially developed to provide an automated way to turn on my wife's curlers every morning. Many would say, why not use an analog timer that some people use to turn on lighting displays for Halloween, or control lamps to turn on and off when they are away on vacation. The problems are: 1) When the power goes out, they forget what time it is, and need to be reset. 2) They don't know about weekends. 3) They can't easily be overridden, if you want to start early, stop early, or cancel all together. 4) They generally don't handle heavy loads.

When I thought about it, I could have solved problem 1 with a UPS. But really, a UPS for hair curlers? I could have solved problem 2 with a much more expensive commercial product, but what fun is that? And besides, it probably didn't support a heavy load anyway. The 3rd problem could have been solved with some sort of remote switch, or by bringing the whole timer device up to the makeup table, but either would have been ugly. The last problem could have been solved with an industrial timer, but those are not very user friendly, and if brought to the top of the makeup table, would have been a show stopper.

Thus was born, the arduino digital timer. I knew that if I designed the hardware and wrote the code for the microcontroller, I could handle all of the issues above, and maybe even provide a very elegant solution to plugging and unplugging cords every morning. And then wondering later if they were unplugged...
